# HTTP-Socket-Programming
# Server 
#### 1) assign every new client to a new thread 
#### 2) can handle GET and POST requests 
#### 3) in case of GET request, it response with OK 200 and the file or Not Found 404 in case of the file doesn't exist
#### 4) in case of POST it save the file into the server and response with OK 202
#### 5) add a dynamic timeout ( depending on the current number of clients on the server ) for each client so avoid useless waiting on an unused socket
#### 6) handle larage images and text files



# Client 

#### 1) for each request assign it to a new thread to allow pipelining
#### 2) use mutex to avoid race condition between threads
